Q1.

The 'Q1.ipynb' contains two functions: 'mean_std' and 'conditional_prob' for 
calculating the mean, STD and conditional probability. The 'mean_std' function asks for N (total number of cards in a deck) and M (number of suits to equally divide card between). Also, 'conditional_prob' function needs N (total number of cards in a deck), M (number of suits to equally divide card between), lowP and highP.

Results:
1) N=26, M=2: Mean: 11.9945 , STD: 2.489684668788399
2) N=52, M=4: Mean: 12.0007 , STD: 3.0286101614436944
3) conditional probability that P>12 given that it's P>6 when N=26 and M=2 : 0.42341
4) conditional probability that P>12 given that it's P>6 when N=52 and M=4 :  0.43755

Q2.

'Q2.ipynb' contains the solutions.
In Q7, the unique county helps us to find largest county in MT by using Google. because we don't have enough information in this DB.
